        <p class="cr">Cricket is an exciting outdoor game in India and is played in many countries worldwide. However, it is not so popular in the United States. Played is a fascinating game in many countries like India, England, and Australia. It is a beautiful game played using a bat and a ball in the open space on the big field. It is my favourite sport. I generally used to see only cricket on the TV whenever any national or international cricket competition occurred. In cricket, two teams have 11 players in each team. One team starts batting first, and another team does bowling according to the toss winning. The team who wins the toss does batting first; however, both teams can do batting alternatively</p></div>
